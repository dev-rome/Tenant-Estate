## Project Description
Tenant-Estate is a home/apartment listing app that allows user to rent or sell their property. 
Users that are not register will be able to view the homes and apartments on both buy and rental page. 
Once a non register user clicks a place to view all they would see is the name, location, images, info and description of home/apartment. 
User will have to register and login to be able to post their home/apartment to the site. 
Also when user is logged in they will be able to see and make reviews. 
There is also a map for the user to see the location of the home/apartment they are viewing.
